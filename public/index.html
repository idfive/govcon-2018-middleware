<h1>Welcome to the Starships</h1>
<p>We have created a few simple client examples to help you reference how to interact with this API. There are several great tutorials on the web that will give you the basics of graphQl, which is beyond the scope of this page.</p>

<p>GraphQl testing tool:</p>
<ul>
  <li>GraphQl endpoint available at: <a href="/graphql">/graphql</a></li>
  <li>Endpoints are self documenting within this tool. Simply run your sample queries directly in <a href="/graphql">/graphql</a>, and look at the documentation tab, which will show you available fields, filters, etc.</li>
</ul>
